/* Create a program that finds the product of two positive numbers without using the 
multiplication operator (*). The program should ask the user for the first positive number. 
The program should then ask the user for the second positive number. The program should then 
calculate the product of these two numbers without using the multiplication operator. The 
program should end by displaying the product of these two numbers. The program does not need 
to check if the user enters a negative number.  
1. Ask user the first positive number
2. Save 
3. Ask for second positive number
4. Save
5. Calculate two numbers without using multiplication 
6. Print out the product of the two numbers
7. Does not need to check if it's a negative number
